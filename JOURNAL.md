## 10/23/2025 - Started to research on parts I need.  

Raspberry Pi – candidate for main processor (likely Pi 3 or Pi 4).
FPGA Board – FPGA will handle hardware-level tasks and allow experimentation. I will make my own.
Display – LCD or IPS (5-7 inch) with HDMI connection.
Controls – analog sticks, D-pad, buttons.
Audio – stereo speakers + small amplifier board.
Battery – rechargeable Li-ion pack with charging circuit.
Custom PCB – to integrate controls, power management, and possibly FPGA connections.
Case – will be 3D printed (PLA)
